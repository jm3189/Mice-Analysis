# Mice-Analysis
(brief summary) Analysis of mice data merging separate CSV files using python and creating data visualizations to find trends.

Analysis
In this data set we compared various cancer treating drugs on mice and analyzed the data and graphing any key findings.
The line chart graphed helps visualize how effective Capomulin was in reducing the tumor size in mice over time.
Comparing the tumor size to weight we see that the data has a positive correlation.  
This could be explained by the overall tumor mass adding to the natural weight of the mice.
Based on my findings Capomulin was very successul in reducing tumor sizes.
